This repository contains a collection of Python scripts developed during the Winter Internship 2024. Each script performs a specific operation on numerical inputs, focusing on digit manipulation and basic computations. Below is a brief description of each script included in the repository.

## Repository Contents

1. **1stp.py**: Converts each digit of an input number into its English word representation (e.g., "123" becomes "onetwothree").
2. **2nd.py**: Counts the occurrences of a specific digit in a given number and prints the count.
3. **3rd.py**: Calculates the sum of each digit raised to its own power (e.g., for "123", computes 1¹ + 2² + 3³).
4. **4th.py**: Checks if all digits in a number are unique, returning `True` if they are, and `False` otherwise.
5. **5th.py**: Computes the product of all digits in a given number.
6. **6th.py**: Checks if a specific digit exists in a number, returning `True` if found, and `False` otherwise.
7. **7th.py**: Sums the digits at even positions (0-based index) in a given number.
8. **8th.py**: Swaps the first and last digits of a number and prints the result.
9. **9th.py**: Finds the difference between the maximum and minimum digits in a number.
10. **10th.py**: Removes all occurrences of a specific digit from a number and prints the resulting string.

## Usage

- Each script prompts the user to input a number (and sometimes an additional digit) via the console.
- The scripts assume valid input (e.g., strings of digits). Ensure inputs are numeric strings to avoid errors.
- To run a script, execute it using Python (e.g., `python 1stp.py`) and follow the input prompts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are required; all scripts use standard Python functionality.

## Notes

- The scripts are designed for educational purposes, focusing on basic string and digit manipulation.
- Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric characters) is not implemented. Users should provide valid numeric strings.
- For further details, refer to the individual script files.
